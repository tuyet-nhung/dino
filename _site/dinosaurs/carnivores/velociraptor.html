<p><em>Velociraptor</em> is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period, with species discovered in Mongolia, China.</p>

<p>Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than <em>Velociraptor</em> are known to have had feathers covering their bodies and fully developed feathered wings. The fact that the ancestors of <em>Velociraptor</em> were feathered and possibly capable of flight had long suggested to paleontologists that Velociraptor bore feathers as well, since even flightless birds today retain most of their feathers.</p>
