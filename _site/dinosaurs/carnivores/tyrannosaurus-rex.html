<p><em>Tyrannosaurus</em> (meaning “tyrant lizard”) is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The species <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> (rex meaning &quot;king&quot; in Latin), commonly abbreviated to <em>T. rex</em>, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, at the time an island continent termed Laramidia, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.</p>

<p>Like other tyrannosaurids, <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> forelimbs were small, though unusually powerful for their size, and bore two clawed digits.</p>
