<p><em>Apatosaurus</em>, including the popular but scientifically redundant synonym <em>Brontosaurus</em>, is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived from about 154 to 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period (Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages).</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of <em>Diplodocus</em> and the bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, <em>Apatosaurus</em> had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.</p>
