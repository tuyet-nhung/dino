<p><em>Triceratops</em> is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, around 68 to 65.5 million years ago in what is now North America. It was one of the last non-avian dinosaur genera to appear before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event.</p>

<p>Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, and conjuring similarities with the modern rhinoceros, <em>Triceratops</em> is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was preyed upon by the fearsome <a href="tyrannosaurus.html"><em>Tyrannosaurus</em></a>, though it is less certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.</p>
